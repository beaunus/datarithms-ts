# Datarithms

A collection of _data structures_ and _algorithms_.

The motivation behind this repository is to practice solving algorithms in a variety of programming languages.

Most data structures and algorithms have corresponding tests.

To run JavaScript tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

or 

```sh
npm run test -- --watch
```

To run Java tests:

```sh
./mvnw test
```
